# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


Design a registration form to apply higher secondary admission for students. Form should include the following details: ( Name - Address - Mobile - E mail - Gender - Date of birth - Course (dropdown with Biology , Computer Science, Commerce, Humanities as options) - Button for register and cancel).  When Student click register, it should alert as data stored successfully and display the user inputted data along the alert. When student click on cancel all data in the text box should be reset. Make sure to apply  user input validation to all fields as well.
